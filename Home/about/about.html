			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Intra-School Student Organization</strong> (OSIS) is the only official organization in schools recognized by the Ministry of National Education of the Republic of Indonesia since March 21, 1970. This organization has a role as an activator for students to actively contribute to school.[1] It is a forum for Student Development in schools to develop students' interests, talents and potential. It serves as a forum for discussing various matters regarding further schooling, such as events, competitions, etc.</p><br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSIS starts at Middle School, namely Junior High School (SMP) and High School (SMA). Some of the OSIS tasks: preparing school events by submitting proposals to the school through various considerations and mutual agreements, collecting contributions from each school member for funding activities and donations to school members who have been hit by misfortune.</p>
			<br>
			<h2 id="judul">History</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the birth of OSIS, in junior and senior high schools there were organizations of various kinds. There are student organizations formed only by the school itself, and there are also student organizations formed by student organizations outside the school. Student organizations that are formed and have relationships with student organizations from outside the school, some of which lead to political matters, so that the activities of these student organizations are controlled from outside the school as a place for the teaching and learning process to be held. As a result of such a situation, a double loyalty arises, on the one hand one has to carry out the rules made by the principal, while on the other hand one has to submit to student organizations which are controlled outside of school.</p><br>
